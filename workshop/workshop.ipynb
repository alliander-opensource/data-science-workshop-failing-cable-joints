    "## Introduction\n",
    "Our powergrid is an intricate network of cables/lines and stations that transport electricity from powerplants, solar parcs, wind parcs, etc. to e.g. your home. Within this network the cables are connected using cable joints (or 'Moffen' in Dutch). A range of joint types are used in our grid as these have improved over time. Older joints might experience failure due to a range of conditions. One of Alliander's main objectives is to have a reliable grid. Therefore, it is important to know which joint types are prone to failure in order to prevent power failures. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today, Alliander is going to ask you to come up with a way to predict cable joint failures using classification models. We know that joints fail due to large temperature variations and subsequently cause short circuits. The failure of cable joints is difficult to determine. However, we know that there is a relationship between a joint failure and the depth of a joint, the joint type, soil type and groundwater level. We also know that joint type is the most dominant factor to joint failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the information supplied above and the supplied dataset containing information on the cable joints present in our grid, try to come up with classification models that predict the failure of cable joints."
