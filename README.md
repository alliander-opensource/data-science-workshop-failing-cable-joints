# Data Science Workshop: Predict Failing Cable Joints

### What is this workshop about?
Let's try to predict which cable joints ('Moffen') are most likely to fail. 
This can be used to perform *preventive maintainance*.

In this hands-on workshop you will experience all facets of a Data Science project: from dataset to model.
The workshop is fully contained in a jupyter notebook and (reference) solutions are included in a seperate notebook.  
The dataset in this workshop is a dummy and is meant for learning purposes. 

### How to install
Install the nessecary python packages and you are good to go:
