# Data Science Workshop: Predict Failing Cable Joints

### What is this workshop about?
Let's try to predict which cable joints ('Moffen') are most likely to fail. 
This can be used to perform *preventive maintainance*.

In this hands-on workshop you will experience all facets of a Data Science project: from dataset to model.
The workshop is fully contained in a jupyter notebook and (reference) solutions are included in a seperate notebook.  
The dataset in this workshop is a dummy and is meant for learning purposes. 

### How to install
You can either clone this repo and run it locally, or use a [github codespace](https://github.com/codespaces) for that.

#### Github Codespace
1. Go to [github codespace](https://github.com/codespaces)
1. Select this repository
1. A pod with the correct environment and packages is automatically created:)

#### Locally
1. Clone the repository
1. Create a virtual environment. E.g. `conda create -n cable_joints python=3.10`
1. Install the nessecary python packages and you are good to go: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
